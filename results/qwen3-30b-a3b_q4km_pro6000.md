# Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M — sparkinfer vs llama.cpp

**Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition (sm_120, 96 GB, CUDA 12.8)
**Model:** Qwen3-30B-A3B, Q4_K_M GGUF (17.3 GiB), 48 layers, 128 experts top-8
**Setting:** single stream, batch = 1, greedy decode

| Engine | Decode (tg) | VRAM | gap to llama.cpp |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| llama.cpp (CUDA) | **240.5 tok/s** | 17.3 GB | 1.0× |
| sparkinfer — pass 4 (current) | **~119 tok/s** | 21.7 GB | **2.0×** |
| sparkinfer — pass 3 (CUDA graph) | 118.7 tok/s | 21.7 GB | 2.0× |
| sparkinfer — pass 2 (decode GEMV) | 84.4 tok/s | 21.7 GB | 2.85× |
| sparkinfer — pass 1 (fused experts) | 32.7 tok/s | 21.7 GB | 7.3× |
| sparkinfer — baseline | 0.60 tok/s | 23.3 GB | 400× |

**4 optimization passes: 0.60 → ~119 tok/s (≈200×), gap to llama.cpp 400× → 2.0×.**

Passes: (1) fused selected-expert quantized GEMV — dequant only the 8 routed
experts on-read; (2) decode GEMV for dense projections (coalesced [out,in],
replacing M=1 tiled GEMM); (3) CUDA-graph the whole decode step (capture once,
replay per token); (4) 128-bit vectorized GEMV loads.

### Profile of the remaining 8.4 ms/token (ablation, no NCU)
| Component | Cost | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Attention block (QKV/O GEMV + RoPE + KV-append + gqa) | 3.4 ms | 40% |
| └ gqa attention kernel alone | 1.2 ms | 14% |
| MoE (router + fused experts) | ~0 ms | ~0% |
| LM head + norms + residuals + rest | ~5.0 ms | 60% |

The remaining gap is spread across many small **latency-bound** GEMVs (vectorizing
the loads gave ~0 — they're not bandwidth-bound at bs=1), not one hot kernel.
Next levers: flash-decoding attention (KV-split for occupancy + long-context
scaling), and higher-throughput small-N GEMV (more outputs/warp, split-K).

(historical first-pass note below.)

**Optimization pass 1: 0.60 → 32.7 tok/s (~55×), gap to llama.cpp 400× → 7.3×.**

The win came from the fused selected-expert kernel (`expert_ffn_q4k.cu`): dequantize
only the 8 routed experts (not all 128) on-read inside a warp-per-output-row GEMV,
with per-tensor Q4_K/Q6_K dispatch (Q4_K_M mixes the two per layer). Output is
correct ("The capital of France is Paris.").

The remaining ~7× to llama.cpp is the next pass:

## Optimization roadmap

1. ✅ **DONE — Fused selected-expert GEMV.** Dequantize only the 8 routed experts
   (not all 128), on-read inside a warp-per-row GEMV. Was ~16× wasted dequant +
   ~16 GB redundant traffic/token; now gone. **0.60 → 32.7 tok/s.** Experts are
   ~90% of FLOPs, so this was the single biggest lever.

2. **No tensor cores.** Our GEMV/GEMM are scalar CUDA-core kernels. For decode (bs=1)
   the experts are memory-bound so this matters less there, but the dense
   projections (Q/K/V/O, router, LM head) still run as tiled GEMM with M=1 (very
   inefficient). Fix: a proper GEMV for the dense bf16 projections; dp4a/MMA for
   prefill.

3. **Dense projections via M=1 tiled GEMM.** The Q/K/V/O/router/LM-head GEMMs use a
   16×16 tiled GEMM with one row → ~16× wasted threads. A dedicated GEMV would help.

4. **Per-token host sync, no CUDA graph.** `forward_token` syncs the stream and
   copies the argmax to host every token; ~48 layers × many tiny kernel launches,
   uncaptured. Fix: CUDA-graph the decode step, keep sampling on-device (the
   runtime is already sync-free up to the final argmax).

5. **Naive paged attention** (scalar gqa8, re-reads KV each step).

The #1 fix alone (fused selected-expert quantized GEMV) attacks both the 16×
dequant waste *and* the tensor-core gap on the dominant compute.

## Notes
- Correctness is established separately: sparkinfer produces the same answers as
  the model ("The capital of France is Paris." + EOS); this run measures speed only.
- VRAM: sparkinfer is higher (23.3 vs 17.3 GB) because dense weights are stored
  bf16 (~3 GB extra), plus the per-layer expert dequant scratch (~1.6 GB) and a
  bf16 KV cache. The fused path removes the scratch and can quantize dense too.
